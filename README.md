# Project-One
Sleep Health and Lifestyle 

Group Members: Katherine Oâ€™Malley, Francis Sulkowski, Gerald Dixon, Lauren Matos & May Hli Yang 

In Project One we answer four questions about sleep and lifestyle. 
 1. How does BMI relate to sleep disorders?
 2. Do different occupations influence sleep disorders?
 3. Which gender has more sleep disorders?
 4. Does increased age negatively/positively affect sleep duration?

Each team member coded at least one graph and researched general inforamtion about sleep and how it impacts life and how lifestyle impacts sleep to best answer the questions.

Sleep directly impacts the way one feels when awake PLUS how well one thinks, reacts, works, learns, gets along with others and more! 

With this in mind we investigated how occupation, BMI, gender and age impact sleep disorders and duration. 

Conclusions:

- An overweight BMI increased the count of Insomnia and Sleep Apnea sleep disorders, which a normal BMI has an overwhelming high occurance of no sleep disorders
- Certain occupations have a higher occurance of sleep disorders. Examples include Nurses have a large count of Sleep Apnea, Salesperson and teachers have a high count of Insomnia. 
- Lawyers, Doctors, Engineers, Nurses and Teaches have the highest stress levels
-  Females have higher rates of Sleep Apnea, while males have slighter higher rates of Insomnia
- Sleep Duration fluxates with age, peaking when over 55 and dipping in the 30s and 40s.

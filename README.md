# Project-One
Sleep Health and Lifestyle 

Group Members: Katherine O’Malley, Francis Sulkowski, Gerald Dixon, Lauren Matos & May Hli Yang 

Each team member coded at least one visual and researched general information about sleep and how it impacts life and how lifestyle impacts sleep to best answer the questions.

Sleep directly impacts the way one feels when awake PLUS how well one thinks, reacts, works, learns, gets along with others and more! 

With this in mind we investigated how occupation, BMI, gender and age impact sleep disorders and duration.

In Project One we answer four questions about sleep and lifestyle. 

 1. How does BMI relate to sleep disorders?
 2. Do different occupations influence sleep disorders?
 3. Which gender has more sleep disorders?
 4. Does increased age negatively/positively affect sleep duration?

 
CONCLUSIONS:

1. How does BMI relate to sleep disorders? 

    - Key findings:
        - Abnormal blood pressure levels do relate to the sleep disorders
        - Abnormal BMI levels show a significant relation to the sleep disorders
    - Area chart:
        - Illustrates abnormal blood pressure levels with high peaks of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea
        - Lower blood pressures show a higher range of no sleep disorders
    - Clustered bar graph:
        - Normal BMI levels show a peak high of no sleep disorders
        - Abnormal BMI ranges illustrate higher counts of sleep disorders
    - Conclusion:
        - Yes, sleep apnea and high blood pressure are closely linked. Both conditions have high risks of other
        - Abnormal BMI levels increase the risk of sleep disorders and have negative effects to overall health considering sleep and BMI are key roles to health

2. Do different occupations influence sleep disorders?

    - Key Findings:
        - Jobs with higher stress levels tend to have a greater prevalence of sleep disorders.
        - Nursing and sales are high-stress professions with high occurrences of sleep apnea and insomnia.
        - Engineering and law professions exhibit lower levels of stress and a correspondingly lower prevalence of sleep disorders.
    - Stacked Bar Graph Analysis:
        - Illustrates sleep disorders associated with different occupations.
        - Nurses have a high number of sleep apnea diagnosis.
        - Many sales professionals report insomnia.
        - Some occupations show a majority of individuals reporting no sleep disorders, like accounting, law and engineering.
    - Heatmap Analysis:
        - Illustrates stress levels associated with different occupations.
        - Nurses: Report some of the highest stress levels, aligning with higher sleep disorder rates.
        - Engineers: Have lower stress levels (around 3 out of 10), reflecting fewer sleep disorders.

    - Conclusion:
        - Higher stress levels in occupations are linked to a greater prevalence of sleep disorders.
        - Professions like nursing and sales, with significant stress and emotional strain, show higher rates of disorders like sleep apnea and insomnia.
        - Highlights the direct impact of job-related stress on sleep health.

 3. Which gender has more sleep disorders?

    - Key Findings : 	
        - Women are more prone to sleep disorders than men. 
        - Occupation can clearly affect people's sleep. 
    - Stacked Bar Chart of Sleep Disorders:
        - Women are more likely to have sleeping disorders, this can be due to several factors, including hormonal changes, housework, caregiving responsibilities, and juggling different responsibilities with work.
    - Scatter Plot Occupation by Count:
        - Men often are more likely to have occupations that are at a lower percentage of sleep disorders. Meanwhile, women are more likely to have occupations with a higher percentage of sleep disorders.
    - Conclusion: 
        - Due to biological factors, caregiving responsibilities, and the impact with occupation, all these factors can contribute to higher or lower prevalence of sleep issues among genders. 

4. Does increased age negatively/positively affect sleep duration?

    - From the early 20’s to the low 30’s we see an increase in sleep duration. This can be attributed to active lifestyles that someone between this age range has such as staying up late for school studying, caffeine, social activities, and work. 
    - What’s also interesting is the Sleep Duration drop significantly between 30 and 35. On average, the American couple start to have children in between the ages of 27 through 36, so knowing that, it isn’t surprising to see the sleep duration numbers decrease within this age group. According to National Library of Medicine, this age group stage 3 rapid eye movement decreases by 2 percent from this time to the 60’s. And also around this time, you’re dealing with work schedules, family obligations, financial stress, and use of technology. 
    - As for sleep disorders by age, we see between the ages of 40-48 dealing with sleep insomnia and it’s most likely because of menopause which is a change in how much estrogen women are producing which can affect mood, night sweats, and hot flashes.
    - Sleep apnea increases in the mid 40’s to the mid 50’s and again around age 60. This mostly by men due to weight increase, alcohol intake, and decreased physical activity.
